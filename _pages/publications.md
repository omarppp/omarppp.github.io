    <strong>Summary:</strong>
    A practical assistive wearable system designed to support blind users in daily mobility and independent object/food evaluation.
    The solution combines 3D-printed smart glasses with a Raspberry Pi camera and distance sensors (ultrasonic + IR) to perceive the surroundings and estimate obstacle proximity in real time.
    Processing is performed on a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) embedded within a lightweight gauntlet.
    Three YOLOv8 models are used for pathway detection, obstacle detection, and fruit identification, with real-time audio feedback delivered via an onboard speaker.
    The design prioritizes low cost, energy efficiency, and real-world usability.

      The Smart obstacle &amp; object detection glasses project aims to help blind people in their daily lives by supporting both safe navigation and independent evaluation of food.
      The system uses 3D-printed smart glasses with a Raspberry Pi camera, ultrasonic and IR sensors to estimate obstacle proximity, and a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) for on-device processing.
      Three YOLOv8 models are employed for pathway detection, obstacle detection, and fruit identification, with real-time audio feedback for navigation and safety guidance.

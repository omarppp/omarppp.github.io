    <strong>Summary:</strong>
    A practical assistive wearable system designed to support blind users in daily mobility and independent object/food evaluation.
    The solution combines 3D-printed smart glasses with a Raspberry Pi camera and distance sensors (ultrasonic + IR) to perceive the surroundings and estimate obstacle proximity in real time.
    Processing is performed on a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) embedded within a lightweight gauntlet.
    Three YOLOv8 models are used for pathway detection, obstacle detection, and fruit identification, with real-time audio feedback delivered via an onboard speaker.
    The design prioritizes low cost, energy efficiency, and real-world usability.

## AI & Mechatronics Engineer (Robotics • Embedded Systems • Computer Vision)

AI & Mechatronics Engineer with practical experience in building integrated systems that combine hardware, firmware, and perception. I work across the full development cycle—requirements definition, system design, implementation, integration, testing, and iteration—until the system operates reliably and can be maintained and improved over time.

My work frequently sits at the intersection of robotics and AI: connecting perception outputs to real system behavior (control decisions, actuation, monitoring, and operational workflows). I focus on technical clarity, predictable performance, and engineering choices that support real-world deployment.

**Current:** EG Robotics (Robotics & Embedded)  
**Location:** Cairo, Egypt

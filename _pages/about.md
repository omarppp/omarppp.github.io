## AI & Mechatronics Engineer — Robotics, Embedded Systems, and Applied AI

I build practical, reliable systems that bridge intelligent software with real-world hardware. My work focuses on robotics and embedded development, with applied AI and data-driven evaluation when it makes the product better—not just the demo.

I’m currently working at **EG Robotics**, and I’ve trained across multiple engineering environments—covering embedded/robotics, hardware bring-up, PCB design, and analytical workflows in data science.

## What I Do

### Robotics & Control
Design and integrate robotic subsystems—sensing, actuation, and control—aiming for predictable behavior under real constraints (latency, noise, power, reliability).

### Embedded Systems & Hardware Integration
Develop firmware and interfaces, handle hardware bring-up, debug at the signal and protocol level, and connect sensors/actuators into coherent, testable systems.

### Applied AI & Data Work
Use machine learning and data analysis where they create measurable value—model integration, performance evaluation, and iteration driven by metrics.

## Selected Work (Recommended)

If you want the homepage to look “complete” and impressive, add 3–6 cards هنا (حتى لو مشاريع بسيطة).  
اكتب اسم كل مشروع + سطرين: المشكلة → الحل → النتيجة.

- **Robotics Project:** Brief one-liner about the system + your role + key result  
- **Embedded System:** Device/firmware + interfaces + what you validated  
- **PCB Design:** Board purpose + stack/tools + what you tested  
- **Data/AI Work:** dataset/goal + approach + evaluation metric/result  

---

## Working Style

- I prefer **clear requirements**, measurable tests, and iteration based on evidence.  
- I enjoy bridging layers—from hardware constraints to software architecture—until the system behaves predictably in real conditions.  
- I document decisions, keep workflows reproducible, and use version control seriously.

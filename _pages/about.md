## AI & Mechatronics Engineer

I am an AI & Mechatronics Engineer focused on building practical, dependable systems that connect software intelligence to real-world hardware. My work sits at the intersection of robotics, embedded development, and applied machine learning—where requirements, constraints, and reliability matter as much as innovation. I approach engineering with a structured, implementation-driven mindset: define the problem clearly, design for robustness, validate with measurable tests, and iterate until the system behaves predictably in real conditions.

Across projects and hands-on training, I have developed strong fundamentals in electronics and embedded firmware, along with the ability to integrate sensors, actuators, and computation into coherent solutions. I am comfortable moving between layers—from low-level debugging and hardware bring-up, to control logic, to AI model integration and optimization. I value clean documentation, reproducible workflows, and version-controlled development, and I aim to deliver outcomes that are testable, maintainable, and ready for real deployment—not just demonstrations.

## Personal Information

**Full Name:** Omar Hussein Nady  
**Role:** Robotics & Mechatronics Engineer | Embedded Systems | Applied AI  
**Current Position:** EG Robotics (Robotics / Mechatronics Engineering)  
**Primary Interests:** Robotics, Mechatronics, Computer Vision, Applied AI, Data Science

## Personal Summary

I am a Robotics & Mechatronics Engineer with a strong focus on building practical, dependable systems that operate reliably in real environments. My core interest is robotics engineering—where performance is defined by consistency, safety, and maintainability under real constraints such as sensor noise, timing limitations, power constraints, and imperfect operating conditions.

My work combines mechatronics fundamentals with applied AI and data-driven engineering. I enjoy taking a system from concept to a working prototype by integrating sensing, embedded control, and perception into a coherent architecture. I am particularly interested in computer vision solutions, building pipelines with **OpenCV** and using **YOLO**-based object detection when perception needs to be robust and actionable.

I approach engineering with structured discipline: clarify the objective, design for constraints, validate with measurable tests, and iterate until behavior is predictable and reproducible. I value clear documentation, version-controlled workflows, and engineering decisions that support long-term maintainability—not just short-term demos.

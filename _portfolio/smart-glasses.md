## Overview
This project presents an assistive smart-glasses system designed to support blind users in daily mobility and independent object/food evaluation. The solution combines wearable hardware with embedded AI to deliver real-time scene understanding and audio guidance.

## My Role
- End-to-end system design and integration (wearable form factor + processing unit).
- Computer vision pipeline implementation and optimization for edge deployment.
- Model integration for real-time inference and user feedback workflow.

## Technical Stack
- **Embedded AI / Edge Computing:** Raspberry Pi 4
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Object Detection:** YOLOv8
- **Sensors:** Ultrasonic + IR distance sensing
- **Output:** Real-time audio feedback

## Key Highlights
- Real-time pathway/obstacle detection to assist safe navigation.
- On-device inference for low-latency and offline usage scenarios.
- Practical deployment-oriented design with focus on usability and efficiency.

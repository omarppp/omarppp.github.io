## Overview
A practical assistive wearable designed to support blind users in daily mobility and independent object/food evaluation.  
The solution integrates a 3D-printed smart glasses form factor with real-time sensing (ultrasonic + IR) and a Raspberry Pi camera, enabling situational awareness and distance estimation in everyday environments.

## My Role
I led the end-to-end engineering work including system architecture, embedded implementation, model integration, and validation planning.  
This included hardware integration, on-device inference setup, and designing an interaction loop that prioritizes clarity, responsiveness, and real-world usability.

## System Highlights
- Real-time sensing using ultrasonic + IR for proximity estimation.
- On-device computer vision pipeline with YOLOv8 for detection tasks.
- Audio feedback to guide navigation and communicate detected objects.
- Designed for practicality: lightweight, low-cost, and energy-efficient build.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB), Raspberry Pi Camera, Ultrasonic + IR sensors
- **Software:** Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, On-device inference
- **Design/Build:** 3D-printed enclosure, integration-focused prototyping
